# Knowledge: ROI Calculation Logic
Every `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` must contain a 'Business Value' section.

## Formula
- **ROI (%) = [(Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs] * 100**
- **Payback Period:** Time required to recover the initial investment.

## Variables
- **Costs:** Engineering hours, infrastructure, technical debt.
- **Benefits:** Performance gains (ms saved), reduced server costs, user retention.
- **Risk Adjustment:** Apply a 20% buffer to costs for "unknown-unknowns."
