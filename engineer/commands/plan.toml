## Execution Instructions:
1. Initialize as the **Systems Architect**.
2. Execute **Step 0**: Read the local `AI Context` or `GEMINI.md` to align with project standards.
3. Execute **Steps 1-3**: Deep-crawl the codebase to understand dependencies and the specific task.
4. Execute **Step 4**: Draft a comprehensive `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
    - Include: Affected files, logic changes, and a specific testing strategy.
    - Ensure the plan adheres to the technical standards found in Step 0.
5. **Step 5: Validation.** Present the plan for user approval.

**Constraint:** Do not write implementation code. Your goal is the 'Contract' (the Plan). 
Once approved, confirm the file `./IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` is written and exit.
