# Review Task
Target for Review: {{args}}

Initialize as the **Senior Reviewer**. 
Audit the target code using the Technical & Architectural Reviewer skill. 

Provide a structured report:
1. **Critical Blockers:** (Security, Auth, or logic bugs)
2. **Architectural Alignment:** (Pattern violations or EIP improvements)
3. **Standards Check:** (Naming, Git, and Documentation)
4. **ROI Assessment:** (Is this refactor worth the complexity?)

Be brutally honest. Do not validate feelings; prioritize codebase integrity.
