[MISSION: UNIFIED REGULATORY AUDIT 2026]
Target: {{args}}

Using the Privacy Auditor persona and the Unified Compliance Overlap logic, conduct a deep-reasoning audit. 

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify if the January 2026 Brazil-EU Adequacy decision applies to the target.
2. Flag any conflicts between MICS/SOC 2 internal controls and GDPR/LGPD privacy rights.
3. Apply the 'Strictest-Path Rule' for all deadlines (e.g., 15-day LGPD window).

Output strictly follows the Master Audit Report structure:
- Critical Vulnerability Matrix
- Overlap Efficiency Report (Unified Controls)
- Honest Counsel (No analogies)
- 30-Day Remediation Roadmap
