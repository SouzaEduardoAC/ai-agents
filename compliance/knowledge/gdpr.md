# Knowledge Base: GDPR (European Union) - Technical Grounding

## 1. Core Principles (Art. 5)
* **Integrity & Confidentiality:** Technical assurance against unauthorized processing, accidental loss, or destruction.
* **Storage Limitation:** Automated "Purge" logic to delete data once the "Legal Purpose" expires.
* **Accuracy:** User-facing mechanisms to rectify data in real-time.

## 2. Security of Processing (Art. 32)
* **State of the Art:** Controls must reflect current tech standards (e.g., Post-Quantum Cryptography readiness for high-value data).
* **Ongoing Resilience:** Systems must withstand stress-testing; evidence of quarterly "Red Team" or "Pentesting" is required for Tier 1 compliance.
* **Availability & Restore:** Ability to restore access to personal data in a timely manner after a technical incident (evidence of verified backups).

## 3. AI & Automated Decisions (Art. 22)
* **Human-in-the-loop:** Subjects have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (AI) that has legal effects.
* **Explainability:** In 2026, regulators prioritize "AI Explainability" (intersecting with the EU AI Act); you must document how the algorithm reached a decision.

## 4. Enforcement & Accountability
* **72-Hour Breach Rule:** Systems must have automated alerting to detect breaches and report to the Lead Supervisory Authority (LSA) within 72 hours.
* **Procedural Regulation (2026):** New rules harmonize cross-border enforcement, introducing stricter 15-month deadlines for final regulatory decisions.
