## The 10 Legal Bases (Art. 7)
Unlike GDPR's 6, LGPD offers 10, including:
1. Consent.
2. Compliance with a legal/regulatory obligation.
3. Public administration execution.
4. Research studies.
5. Contract execution.
6. Regular exercise of rights in judicial proceedings.
7. Protection of life.
8. Health protection (by health professionals).
9. Legitimate interest.
10. Credit protection.

## Key Distinctions
* **ANPD:** The National Data Protection Authority.
* **The "DPO" (Encarregado):** Every controller must appoint an Encarregado, though ANPD may waive this for small businesses.
* **International Transfers:** Permitted to countries with similar protection levels or via standard contractual clauses.
