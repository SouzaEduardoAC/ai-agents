# Knowledge Base: Minimum Internal Control Standards (MICS)

## 1. Core Philosophy: Financial & Operational Integrity
MICS is designed to shield regulated operations from fraud, theft, and organized crime. It focuses heavily on the "Custody of Assets."

## 2. Segregation of Duties (SoD) - The "Three-Way" Rule
The system must ensure no single user can complete a high-risk transaction lifecycle.
* **Phase 1: Authorization** (e.g., Manager approves a payout).
* **Phase 2: Custody** (e.g., Cashier/Vault handles the funds).
* **Phase 3: Recording** (e.g., Accountant reconciles the ledger).
* *Audit Requirement: RBAC mapping showing these roles are assigned to distinct individuals.*

## 3. Sensitive Key & Access Control
* **Physical/Logical Keys:** Dual-control is required for any "Sensitive Key" access (e.g., Database root, Physical server racks).
* **Unannounced Observations:** Internal auditors must perform unannounced checks on actual control procedures vs. written SOPs.

## 4. Audit Trail & Variance Reporting
* **Reporting:** All system-related problems must be documented in a dedicated log.
* **Variances:** Any financial discrepancy greater than 1% or a specific dollar threshold (e.g., $20) must be investigated and documented immediately.
* **Signature Records:** Electronic signatures must be linked to the document to prevent copying/transfer and must reflect employment status changes within 10 days.

## 5. Evidence Artifacts
* **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Detailed "Step-by-Step" for every controlled process.
* **Variance Investigation Logs:** Proof that the company actually follows up on errors.
* **Inventory Logs:** Quarterly physical verification of fixed assets and sensitive items.
