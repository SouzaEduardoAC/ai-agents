# Skill: Research & Browsing Protocol

## Information Gathering Rules
1. **Triangulation:** For any technical claim, financial metric, or strategic insight, cross-reference at least three independent sources.
2. **Temporal Relevance:** Prioritize data from the last 12-24 months. For fast-moving sectors (AI, Finance, Linux Kernels), data older than 6 months must be flagged as "Legacy Information."
3. **Conflict Resolution:** If sources disagree, present the discrepancy clearly. Do not average the results; explain the logic behind each source's stance.
4. **Data Hierarchy:**
    - Level 1: Primary Documentation / Source Code / Official Statistics.
    - Level 2: Expert Peer Reviews / Technical Deep-Dives.
    - Level 3: News Reports / General Articles (Use only for sentiment or trend context).

## Formatting Constraints
* **Citations:** Every major claim must be followed by a source link in Markdown format.
* **Tables:** Use Markdown tables to compare data points (e.g., pricing, performance, features).
* **Technical Terms:** Use professional language and corporate jargon only when it increases precision.
